# Wokring Towards a Scientific Method of Investing 

Our main objective is to reach a definitive Scientific Method for Investing. We wanted to look at all the main Financial Statements and in these find.
1.	A means to optimize over time. 
2.	A means of measuring and managing risk.
3.	Based of 1 & 2 a means if valuing assets.
We began and had to confine this introductory query to the Balance sheet which offered a multidimensional array of opportunities to learn and practice developmental skills.

We used SinFin to download our csv files.

As mentioned above we restricted ourselves to just the balance sheet and here is a breakdown of the Pandas DataFrames we sliced and concatenated to better be able to display values 

```

balance_sheet_cash_equal = [
["Total Current Assets" ,
"Cash, Cash Equivalents & Short Term Investments", 
"Accounts & Notes Receivable", 
'Treasury Stock', 
'Retained Earnings']]
  
  
  
balance_sheet_tanglibles = [
    ['Total Current Assets',
     "Cash, Cash Equivalents & Short Term Investments",
      "Property, Plant & Equipment, Net",
      "Retained Earnings", 
      "Total Equity"]]
                                  

balance_sheet_intanglibles = [
    ['Treasury Stock', 
     'Long Term Investments & Receivables', 
     'Shares (Basic)', 
     'Shares (Diluted)']]
                                

```

* Technologies 

# Pandas
Package overview
pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

# Matplotlib 
Matplotlib produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and various graphical user interface toolkits.
